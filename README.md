It then allows you to view buckets, which are akin to database folders, using form submission ![bucket viewing](/home/jack/projects/recipe-iterator/screenshots/Screenshot from 2019-01-17 22-34-21.png)

Iterations, akin to files in a folder, can be viewed, created, and edited with forms as well. ![iteration view](screenshots/Screenshot from 2019-01-17 22-34-32.png)

I designed this app with serious kitchen work in mind, a spiral notebook with redundancy and the ability to seen anywhere.

This app uses javaScript, html and css for the frontend, jQuery, node.js, express, mongo/oose, travisCl, mocha and chai for testing, and heroku for deployment.
